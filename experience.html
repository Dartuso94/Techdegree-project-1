          <h2>Favorite Coding Recource</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Throughout the process of building websites, you need content fillers to see what it looks like with your code. Almost all web developers use <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> which is recycled latin gibberish. Below is an example.</p>
          <blockquote>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nullam non tristique nunc. In finibus ultrices aliquet. Aliquam quis consectetur lectus. Curabitur eros diam, commodo vitae enim a, porta tristique mauris. Vestibulum euismod porta nisi ac elementum. Donec fringilla bibendum faucibus. -<a href="https://lipsum.com"><cite>lipsum.com</cite></a></blockquote>
          <p>Although <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> exudes professionalism, I have to admit that it is not my first option. There is another version called <em>Doggo Ipsum</em> which takes the same gibberish-like principles but relates it to dogs.</p>
          <blockquote>Doggo ipsum smol borking doggo with a long snoot for pats borking doggo heck shoober very taste wow borkdrive, wrinkler bork dat tungg tho big ol pupper. You are doing me the shock long bois you are doing me a frighten very jealous pupper, most angery pupper I have ever seen. Very taste wow clouds long water shoob ur givin me a spook heck stop it fren puggo aqua doggo, fat boi corgo lotsa pats blep wow such tempt stop it fren. You are doin me a concern very hand that feed shibe pats big ol pupper, smol borking doggo with a long snoot for pats. -<a href="https://doggoipsum.com/"><cite>doggoipsum.com</cite></a></blockquote>
          <p>Needless to say, I have an obivous go to when it comes to content filler.</p>

        <p>I started learning Front End Web Development in early January of 2021 by starting Treehouse's Techdegree course. For extra sources of input in my spare time, I have have been going onto various coding websites and reading through their available free coding classes. By taking classes daily, I plan to complete the program by the middle of April of 2021.</p>
